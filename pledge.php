        <p>Reducing Our Carbon Footprint: We prioritise the use of renewable energy sources to power our stages, minimising our impact on the environment. Solar panels and wind turbines are employed to harness nature's energy and ensure our festival leaves a light footprint.</p>
        <p>Waste Reduction Initiatives: Through careful planning and partnerships with local recycling facilities, we're committed to minimising waste. Recycling stations are strategically placed throughout the festival grounds, and we encourage attendees to join us in our mission to keep Cornwall clean.</p>
        <p>Nature Conservation Efforts: We work hand-in-hand with local environmental organisations to protect and preserve the natural beauty of Cornwall. Funds raised from our festival go towards initiatives like habitat restoration, wildlife conservation, and reforestation projects.</p>

        <h1 class="second-title">How you can help us</h1>
        <p>Choose Sustainable Transportation: Opt for eco-friendly modes of transportation such as carpooling, cycling, or public transit to get to the festival. Additionally, we offer incentives for attendees who arrive using sustainable transport options.</p>
        <p>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Join us in our waste reduction efforts by utilising the clearly marked recycling stations. Make a conscious effort to minimise single-use items and consider bringing reusable water bottles and containers.</p>
        <p>Support Local and Eco-Friendly Vendors: Indulge in the flavours of Cornwall by patronising our carefully selected food vendors who prioritise sustainable practices. From locally-sourced ingredients to compostable packaging, these vendors share our commitment to the environment.</p>
        <p>Spread the Word: Help us amplify our eco-friendly message. Share your experiences and the steps you've taken to reduce your environmental impact during the festival on social media platforms using our designated hashtags.</p>
